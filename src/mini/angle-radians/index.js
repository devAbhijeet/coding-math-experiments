/**
 *
 * Radius is distance from center of the circle to the edge.
 * If we draw a line from center to edge and from edge to equal distance of radius,
 * to other end of circle edge we form a radian.
 *
 * radina is similar to equilateral trinagle with all sides having same,
 * angle. A one radian is 57.295
 *
 * If we continne wrapping string for one more radina we get 2 radian.
 *
 * 180deg is 3.14 radian or pie
 * 360deg is 3.28 radian or pie
 *
 * pie can be defined as ration of diameter of a cirlce to its,
 * cirmumfurance.
 *
 * pie = circumference/diamter i.e
 * circumference = pei * diameter
 *
 * Now diameter is 2*r, so according to that
 * circumference = pei * 2 * r OR * circumference = r * 2 * pie
 * circumference = 360deg and radous is single radina, so according to that
 * 360deg = 2 * pie * radian
